## Release Notes

v1.2 Release - Asynchronous Authorization
Login and Pay for Magento now support asynchronous authorizations!
How it works
* In the admin configuration, you enable Asynchronous mode by setting the 'Asynchronous Mode' to 'Yes' Now when buyers checkout, the call is asynchronous and the state returned from any Authorize call is 'Pending'
* The system uses Magento's built-in cron job functionality to poll Amazon systems for the status of any Open orders. See http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/1_-_installation_and_configuration/how_to_setup_a_cron_job for more information.
* NOTE Orders will never update to their correct status if you do not have cron enabled as specified in the Magento documentation.
* The polling interval is 5 minutes and when the cron job executes, it will get the new status, update the order in Magento appropriately to your configured 'New Order Status' and, if Authorize and Capture is configured, create the Invoice in Magento.
When should you use async vs sync?
* You should use async when you have large average order values, on the order of > $500-$1000
* You might also consider using async to speed up checkout since the authorizations come back immediately with a 'Pending' status.
* Only merchants who have an existing workflow for reaching out to customer's whose payment method was declined should use the asynchronous model.
